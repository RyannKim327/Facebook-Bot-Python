<h3 style="color: red">Warning</h3>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">&emsp;Must be aware that the account you may use might have some errors while debugging. So must create a whitehat account or dummy account to avoid this issue to your main account. I won't tollerate you to create a dummy account for some illegal activities, but only for educational purposes. This project is created not just for entertainment, but also for you to learn this programming language. This warning may help you to avoid some crash and errors also issues to your main account, that's why I give a warning to you. Don't much be worried, because there is no third party platforms connected to this project except facebook (and other platforms you want to use). I also make this project to user data customized for login credentials.</blockquote>
